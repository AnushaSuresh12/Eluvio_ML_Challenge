# Eluvio_ML_Challenge
The repository consists of an Ensemble model to predict the scene segmentation for each movie with given set of features (place,cast,action,audio).

In order to run the model, we need to provide the dataset link in the filename = "directory of the dataset"

once we start executing each cell in the  jupyter notebook we will get the AP,MAP and MIOU for each input movie file
